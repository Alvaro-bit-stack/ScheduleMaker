#Auto Schedule Maker

I really like having all my class times in a google calender because it gives me reminders on my phone to go to class. Saves my butt all the time because I be forgetting

**BUTTT** I always hated having to manually put all the classes and their times into the google calendar it was very *tedious* in my opinon. So my solution to that was this code. It a little janky and I can imporve it, but it works pretty good for now!

It uses bounding boxes to determine which columns to extract the infromation from in the jpg I provided it. It might not work for different types of schedules than the one provided but I will be imporving on that.

##Necessary Installation to Run it
1.pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
2.pip install google-cloud-vision
3.pip install pillow
4.pip install regex

###One liner of the Above:
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib google-cloud-vision pillow

##Api Information
You will have to make a google cloud for this but its a pretty easy process and their arent many steps.
